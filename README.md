# Brief overview

This is repo is currently me experimenting with R6 classes and AWS Sagemaker Python SDK. The idea is to rebuild [AWS Sagemaker Python SDK](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk) using [R6](https://github.com/r-lib/R6) classes and [paws](https://github.com/paws-r/paws) behind the scenes.
